# SelectProgressBar
  Long time no see,these days,i want to modify the project of a music player which i call it "dongling music".So there is no any custom view or custom viewgroup update.Today i back here to share a new custom view who's name is SelectProgressBar.This custom view just for my music player project.We can get the specific value not percentage from the view,so that wo can modify some elements by touching the view.

# Usage
  You can access following site for the using in my repository.In this project,I use it to get a specific value in a range,such as choose a value for lyrics text size.
